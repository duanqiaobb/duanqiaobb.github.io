# Quotes about Org-mode from the mailing list and the web.

> I honestly don&rsquo;t know how I ever lived without org-mode <div align="right"><i>Luke Gaudreau on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/infosoph).</i></div>

> I&rsquo;m having the same feeling for org-mode that I did when I first learned to really program and use emacs. <div align="right"><i>Jeffery Travis on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/travisjeffery).</i></div>

> Org-mode is one of those tools that change the way you work and think forever. <div align="right"><i>Kaluza [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/kaluza/statuses/40810643061874688)</i></div>

> This handy system uses a fairly simple, single-file outlining paradigm, upon which it overlays concepts like due dates and priorities. I find its method both non-intrusive and easy to edit by hand, which are absolute necessities for me. <div align="right"><i>John Wiegley in 2007 in his [blog post](http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/).</i></div>

> I&rsquo;ve passed 2500 tasks logged with Org-mode! This has been, by far, the most consistently I&rsquo;ve used any organizational tool on any system, ever. :) <div align="right"><i>John Wiegley in 2009 in an Email to the Org-mode author.</i></div>

> Someone mentioned that org-mode is a bit like perl. I agree. Way back, someone described perl as &ldquo;the Swiss army chainsaw of UNIX programming&rdquo;. Over the last 12 months, I think org mode has evolved into something akin to the &ldquo;Swiss army JCB of organisational software&rdquo; (to stretch a metaphor until it screams for mercy!). <div align="right"><i>Pete Phillips in a [post on emacs-orgmode](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/754).</i></div>

> I think a main reason for [Org-mode&rsquo;s] utility is that basic use requires little thought. When I&rsquo;m using it for brainstorming, it&rsquo;s almost like I&rsquo;m not aware that I&rsquo;m using any program &#x2014; I&rsquo;m just thinking. <div align="right"><i>Someone, in Charles Cave&rsquo;s [survey of Org users](http://orgmode.org/survey.html#sec-11)</i></div>

> Org-mode bends the definition of outliners until you realise that outlines are text and text is outline. [&#x2026;] In org-mode, I&rsquo;m&#x2026; not editing a document. I&rsquo;m editing a piece of fiction, one piece at a time. On a computer. In a way that makes sense. <div align="right"><i>Urpo Lankinen in a [blog post](http://beastwithin.org/users/wwwwolf/fantasy/avarthrel/blog/2011/05/lets-just-use-emacs.html).</i></div>

> I&rsquo;m continually amazed by what org can do, and also by how intuitive it is. It&rsquo;s not at all unusual that I find myself thinking that it would be great if Org/Emacs did &ldquo;x&rdquo;, trying what seems to me to be the way that it would do &ldquo;x&rdquo; if it could, and discovering that it functions just as I expect. <div align="right"><i>Someone, in Charles Cave&rsquo;s [survey of Org users](http://orgmode.org/survey.html#sec-11)</i></div>

> I love Org&rsquo;s timeclocking support, and I think you will too. Because it&rsquo;s integrated with your task list, you don&rsquo;t have to switch to separate application or reenter data. <div align="right"><i>Sacha Chua in a [blog post](http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/30/clocking-time-with-emacs-org).</i></div>

> I&rsquo;ve been trying lots of different Web-based GTD task managers like Remember the Milk, Toodledo, and GTDAgenda. I&rsquo;m slowly coming to the conclusion that there&rsquo;s nothing quite like Org for Emacs. <div align="right"><i>Sacha Chua in a [blog post](http://sachachua.com/wp/2009/04/06/nothing-quite-like-org-for-emacs/).</i></div>

> **BG:** We’ve got a lot more books coming out in the pipeline. [&#x2026;] The one which is my favourite is the Emacs Org-Mode Reference Manual. [&#x2026;] Honestly, it’s the greatest Emacs mode in 20 years. [&#x2026;] **CW:** *Would you say Org-Mode is one of the more exciting projects in the Free Software world at the moment?* **BG:** Definitely. Maybe it’s even *the* most exciting. Certainly it’s transformed the way that I organise my work, and I think it has for a lot of other people as well, so it’s software that can revolutionise your life, not just perform a function. <div align="right"><i>Brian Gough of [Netork Theory Limited](http://www.network-theory.co.uk/) in an interview by Chris Woolfrey, published in this [blog post](http://blogs.fsfe.org/fellowship-interviews/?p%3D156).</i></div>

> By far my favorite featureset in org-mode that muse lacks<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> is the table support, which piggybacks on calc to form more of a spreadsheet than table support. Insanely cool. <div align="right"><i>Patrick Hawkins in a [post on emacs-wiki-discuss](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.wiki.general/5760).</i></div>

> Org is a new working experience for me and there is nothing comparable to working with emacs AND Org-mode. <div align="right"><i>Sebastian Rose in his [org-info.js documentation](http://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/).</i></div>

> Org-mode definition: Org-mode is an emacs mode for doing anything you dream of. If it can&rsquo;t do it yet, post a message on the mailing list at night, go for a sleep, and grab in the morning a fresh copy with your features implemented. <div align="right"><i>Paul Rivier in an email message to the Org-mode author.</i></div>

> I think I understand the difference between *org-mode* and *planner.el* now.

> I have no idea how long [these files] are, probably 1000 lines each, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I can combine long winded notes about my latest fabrication process with that thing that I have to do on it next week, fold everything back up, and then keep easy tabs on everything using the agenda view. <div align="right"><i>Joey Doll in a [blog post](http://www.guyslikedolls.com/set-phasers-to-org-mode)</i></div>

> If you&rsquo;re like me, over the years you&rsquo;ll have had your todo lists scattered over multiple programs and places. First a simple text file with homebrewn format, then various Windows programs, then various Linux GUI programs, then back to Notepad and joe/gedit/kate, then various apps on cellphones, then pencil & paper (due to cellphones keep getting lost/stolen), then some cloud apps, then todo.txt, then finally org-mode. And if you&rsquo;re anything like me or many others, you&rsquo;ll find that org-mode is **it**. <div align="right"><i>Stephen Haryanto in a [blog post](http://blogs.perl.org/users/steven_haryanto/2011/03/orgparser.html)</i></div>

> While on-topic, just want to clear up misconceptions of org-mode. It is different from all the software/website task managers mentioned here. You can think of it as a meta-organization tool. A org software factory if you will. You can customize it to exactly how you want your thoughts, tasks, notes, etc organized. See <http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html> for an idea of the sheer breadth of options available to make it work exactly for you. This may sound like a lot of work, but there are a lot of sensible defaults, which is why most org-mode tutorials that scratch the surface make it seem like a sibling to other task management software. [&#x2026;] If I may pilfer a quote, org-mode &ldquo;outshines other [task management solutions] in approximately the same way the noonday sun does the stars.&rdquo; (Neal Stephenson on Emacs) <div align="right"><i>Someone in a discussion on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id%3D1230716)</i></div>

> I&rsquo;ve spent a few days reading the manual, and looking at various guides/tutorials on using it, especially with GTD approach &#x2013; and it does everything I want, and so easily (once I&rsquo;ve understood what to do!). <div align="right"><i>Michael Maloney by email</i></div>

> TODO lists in #orgmode is the best thing that happened to creative writing since the metaphor. <div align="right"><i>Keith R. Potempa on [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/keithrpotempa/status/143407790130597888)</i></div>

# Some 24/7 lectures about Org-mode

The famous 24/7 lectures are part of the ceremony for handing out the [Ig Nobel Prizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize). All speakers have to give a 24/7 lecture on their subject. This means, they have to give a *complete technical description* of their work in *24 words* (may be totally cryptic), and then a *7 word* explanation that is more or less *understandable for the public*, and it may be either tongue in cheek or serious. In summer 2008, a few people tried to [formulate](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/7599) such lectures about Org-mode:


<a id="org87b74cc"></a>

## Technical description in 24 words

These was only a single entry in the &ldquo;24&rdquo; category:

-   Org-mode does outlining, note-taking, hyperlinks, spreadsheets, TODO lists, project planning, GTD, HTML and LaTeX authoring, all with plain text files in Emacs (*Carsten Dominik*)


<a id="org6dc8fb5"></a>

## Simple summary in 7 words

This is only a selection of the submitted entries. My loose criterion was to use entries that are either a good description or are funny - both valid approaches to the &ldquo;7&rdquo; part of 24/7 lectures. I also left a few entries which are not exactly seven words, because I liked them a lot.

-   Organize and track everything in plain text (*Bernt Hansen*)

-   Organize outlines, lists and table in text. (*Eddward DeVilla*)

-   Emacs Org Mode: your life in text (*Matthew Parker*)

-   Do work and play in plain text (*Kene Meniru*)

-   Madness? This is org-mode! [**Real Spartans use emacs!**](http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUgrsNBu51nU) (*Russell Adams<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>*)

-   Plain text with frickin&rsquo; lasers. [**pinky to lips**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil) (*Russell Adams<sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>*)

-   It is the text that binds us. [**Shekaka!**](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3Dshikaka) (*Russell Adams<sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>*)

-   Org-mode &#x2014; lifehacker&rsquo;s orgy :-P (*Dmitry Dzhus*)

-   Back to the future for plain text (*Carsten Dominik*)

## Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Muse now understands the syntax of Org-mode tables, so you can use Orgtbl-mode to get the same tables in Muse.

<sup><a id="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> The linked text is from Adam, but the link itself has been added by me.
